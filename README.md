# udacity-project
This project is an udacity's intro to machine learning nanodegree course assignment.  
It has three projects which are implements of Supervised Learning, Deep Learning, and Unsupervised Learning.  

## 1. Finding donors  
In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census.  
You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.  
Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.  
This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  
Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  
While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features.  

## 2. Image Classifier  
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.  
You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at.   
In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application.  

## 3. NOT YET PROCEEDED

# Usage
### Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* Python
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn (v0.17)
* Matplotlib  

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.  
If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
